## **Motivation & Learning Goals**

The goal of this journey is to:
1. **Strengthen Core Concepts**: By solving a diverse range of questions, I aim to deepen my understanding of essential C programming concepts like:
   - **Data Structures**: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, and Queues
   - **Algorithms**: Sorting, Searching, Recursion, Dynamic Programming
   - **Fundamentals of C**: Pointers, Structures, File handling, Functions
2. **Improve Problem-Solving Skills**: Solving problems daily challenges my logical thinking and approach to breaking down complex problems.
3. **Refine Code Efficiency**: I'm constantly exploring ways to optimize my solutions to meet the performance requirements of each platform.

## Problem Categories

- **Easy**: Foundational problems that help build basic programming skills.
- **Medium**: Intermediate challenges that require a solid understanding of algorithms and data structures.
- **Hard**: Advanced problems that challenge my problem-solving abilities and encourage creative thinking.


## **Skills Enhanced**

By working through these problems, Iâ€™ve been able to:
- **Build confidence in handling C syntax and structures** like pointers, arrays, and functions.
- **Break down and solve complex problems** efficiently.
- **Overcome specific challenges** in data manipulation, memory management, and debugging.

Some advanced C concepts I've become more comfortable with include:
- **Data Structures**: Arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees.
- **Pointers**: Understanding pointer arithmetic and memory management.
- **Functions**: Mastering function definitions, recursion, and passing parameters.
- **Structures**: Utilizing structures for organizing complex data types.
- **Algorithm Design**: Developing efficient algorithms for sorting, searching, and manipulating data.
  
These skills are crucial for any developer and lay a strong foundation for more advanced programming languages and concepts.
Working on these problems has allowed me to clarify doubts in challenging topics and deepen my understanding of C programming.
